RStudio Connect can email reports on demand or according to a schedule. Email is just one way in which RStudio Connect allows you to share your work with others. The instructions below explain how to set up and configure email on your server. For more detailed instructions, see [here](https://gist.github.com/adamstac/7462202).

### Install

Install sendmail and restart the web server.

```{bash}
sudo apt-get install sendmail
sudo sendmailconfig
sudo service apache2 restart
```

### Configure

Configure RStudio Connect so that it can send emails via sendmail. For more information see the [RStudio Connect admin guild](http://docs.rstudio.com/connect/admin/getting-started.html#getting-started-email).

```{bash}
sudo vim /etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg
```

Enter the following configuration. Make sure to use your public IP in the address field.

```
# [Server]
# SenderEmail = rstudio
# Address = <public-ec2-ip.region.compute.amazonaws.com>
# [Http]
# Listen = :3939
# NoWarning = true
# [Authentication]
# Provider = password
```

Restart RStudio Connect.

```{bash}
sudo systemctl restart rstudio-connect
```
